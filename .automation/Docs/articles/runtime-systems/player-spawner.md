# Player Spawner
The PlayerSpawner system is responsible for spawning and initializing local and remote players. Players are spawned from a prefab, set to the location of a spawn point provided by the [SceneManager](xref:scene-manager), and then initialized through the [PlayerManager](xref:player-manager).
