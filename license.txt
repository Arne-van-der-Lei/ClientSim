   7.2. Assignability. 
      Licensee may not assign its right, duties, and obligations under this Agreement without VRChat’s prior written consent.

   7.6 Waiver. 
      The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement does not waive any other breach. The failure of any party to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with this Agreement will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of this Agreement.

   7.7 Severability. 
      If any part of this Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. If any material limitation or restriction on the use of VRChat Materials under this Agreement or the TOU is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, Licensee’s right to use VRChat Materials will immediately terminate.

   7.9 Modifications. 
      VRChat reserves the right to amend this Agreement on a going-forward basis at any time. Please check this Agreement periodically for changes. Licensee’s use of VRChat Materials after modifications to this Agreement become effective constitutes binding acceptance of such modifications. If Licensee is dissatisfied with the terms of this Agreement or any modifications to this Agreement, then Licensee agrees that its sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue any use of VRChat Materials.
